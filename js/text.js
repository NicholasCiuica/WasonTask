      infoText: `The rule for Grigg's and Cox's third experiment discussed in their paper
      was "If a person is drinking beer, then the person must be over 19 years of age." This
      thematic rule was designed to test the memory-cueing
      hypothesis, which stated that participants have improved performance on the Wason Selection
      Task when cued with recognizable/everyday experiences (which is why I modified the rule to
      reflect current US drinking age).This type of rule is more modernly categorized as "deontic" 
      because it requires reasoning
      on social rules, rather than the logical reasoning required to solve the original Wason Task.
      \nParticipants performed significantly better on this task than the original abstract task,
      and no transfer effect was recorded between these two tasks (e.i. doing the abstract
      WST after being given this thematic/deontic task did not improve performance on the abstract
      task).`,
